    <h3> Stuart Hendworth, CEO and founding partner of UniTemps </h3>
    <p> I highly recommend Mr Walker for the vacant role at your organisation. He was an invaluable asset for a company at the time of his service and would fit in very well at any company he is to go to. </p>
    <p> he is very punctual and has close to 100% attendance, coming in when in a condition which a lot of other colleague would deem too ill to work and therefore is more reliable than most </p>
    <p> he also showed an ability to learn and adapt to situations quickly, with little to no help required from others around him. </p>

    <h3> Andrew Callman, Manager of Amber Rooms, Loughborough </h3>
    <p> You will notice Jonathon as a valuable asset to your company from the first week he is with you as he puts in 110% all the time and will work well with colleagues around him to get the job done. </p>
    <p> he provided us with 2 years of invaluable service to date and we will all be upset to see him go as he both has helped us at work but has also became like a friend to a lot of his colleagues around him. </p>

    <h3> Steve Worksworth, Chancellor of De Montfort University </h3>
    <p> You cannot say many workers are team-workers, but you can say that about Jonathon as he has constantly checked his team members are doing ok when he has done his task rather than just doing more of his own to try and get out of work and go home. </p>
    <p> he has constantly put all his effort into completing the work to deadlines and could be considered an exemplar student and a lot of his class mates could be considered to be in ore of him. </p>
