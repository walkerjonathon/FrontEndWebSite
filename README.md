21/12/2017: Emailed prototype website around in the morning to people who are de  finetely going to be free to receive testing on both the usability of the general website and to be prepared to combat any issues with google maps if there is any with the API. Of the 3 people who responded with feedback 2 came back suitable whilst the other one was on mobile and engaged with me feedbacking that the google maps has an issue and will require further working to properly work on mobile devices.
