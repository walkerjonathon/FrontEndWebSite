#Change Log:
**20/11/2017**: Added title tag, H1 on home page, style sheet and linked style sheet to homepage.
**21/11/2017**: Added a background color, centered header, changed text color (all on style sheet)
**22/11/2017**: Introduced a table of education history, styled it so odd rows are orange in color whilst even are green, centered all text in the table and introduced border-collapse,with these borders being white, following the text color scheme.
**3/12/2017**: Introduced google maps API with home address location as well as work address, zoomed out to central location of loughborough
**14/12/2017**: used flexbox to store the table and accompanying text so that it improved the layout of the website and also meant that the maps was seperate to that of the table and text.
**21/12/2017**: Emailed prototype website around in the morning to people who are de  finetely going to be free to receive testing on both the usability of the general website and to be prepared to combat any issues with google maps if there is any with the API. Of the 3 people who responded with feedback 2 came back suitable whilst the other one was on mobile and engaged with me feedbacking that the google maps has an issue and will require further working to properly work on mobile devices.
**21/12/2017**: Introduced change log and tidied around to make pages easier to manage as going along. As well as setting up the readme file in markdown format
**22/12/2017**: made website responsive, with the introduction of 3 breakpoints, including adapting these for all current styling, so that it is clear how the device should show the site based on screen width. This will be tested between now and 24th December.
**27/12/2017**: introduced a flexbox containing 4 images, which are my education history. These then were adapted with a figcaption which tells about them, although this feature is removed from mobile version, assumed less than 600px, this is because you can't easily hover on an image on mobile devices. This will again be phased out to be tested by suitable testee's as soon as possible to receive feedback on and act upon.




#Test Log:
**21/12/2017**: Participants were informed that this test was more to focus on the google maps API and the responsiveness and usability of the website in general. This received 3 lots of feedback, two positive and one negative which suggested that there was problems with the google maps, it was recorded that this is needed to be fixed ahead of next iteration of testing. Generally positive feedback for colour scheme, suggestions of over forcing CSS with the table colouring not being appropriate?
**24/12/2017**: testing completed, sent out to people and asked to test it on all devices they had, responses were positive to the majority, one said tablet was ever so slightly unresponsive with googlemaps being ever so slightly out of the screen, changed a couple of pixels on the tables width for the 600px width. The only other negative feedback was that it did not work on a playstation 4 console, this is feedback which is hard to act on as we have not previously investigated this. This feedback will not have implementation based upon.
