    <h3 id="BerryCatering"> Berry Catering </h3>
    <p id="BerryInfo" class="hidden"> I worked for Berry Catering, an agency company in Loughborough, for approximately 2 years, throughout this time I gained vital experienc as it was my first job which I received payment for.

  <h3 id="UniTemps"> UniTemps, De Montfort University </h3>
  <p id="UniTempsInfo" class="hidden"> UniTemps is a company inside of DMU which offer students the chance to work for them and earn money on the side, these are another agency, like my previous work with Berry Catering. These are a company who gave me work at very prestigious venues though and this work was very useful for me as it meant I learnt how to handle larger crowds than that of my previous work. I worked with UniTemps for approximately a year before moving on.</p>

  <h3 id="AmberRooms"> Amber Rooms </h3>
  <p id="AmberRoomsInfo" class="hidden"> This is my most recent, and as to date my current job. This is my first job under which I started working with the same team on a regular basis and it therefore gave me useful skills which I had not developed at previous work, which was learning to develop good bonds and working relationships with colleagues as well as being more confident with the work place itself due to it being inside of the same location dy in day out.</p>
